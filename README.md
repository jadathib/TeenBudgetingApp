# TeenBudgetingApp
 
This is a budgeting app for teens that allows
deposits, allocates a desired percentage of all deposits to savings,
and tracks expenses. The app was created to give teens a way to easily save money
and build up and emergency fund for college.

The project was built during the two day Citi Technology Hackathon.
